# ACOVisualiser
Streamlit dashboard to visualise TSP problems and their ACO-based solutions

Very, VERY work-in-progress - only euclidian 2D distances are calculated properly, and sometimes it just crashes for no good reason (usually when switching between TSPs after a tour has been completed). It's also very very very slow but that's Python and Streamlit I suppose.

Have fun :)
