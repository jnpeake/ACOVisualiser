# ACOVisualiser
Streamlit dashboard to visualise TSP problems and their ACO-based solutions

Very, VERY work-in-progress - distance calculation sometimes is just wrong for some reason, only euclidian 2D distances are calculated properly, and sometimes it just crashes for no good reason (usually when switching between TSPs after a tour has been completed).

Have fun :)
